Hi, I'm Muhammad Nameer Shah.

I'm a second-semester BS Artificial Intelligence student at The University of Agriculture, Peshawar.  
Iâ€™m currently learning Python, exploring how web apps work with Django, and building a foundation in AI and programming concepts.

Most of my time goes into understanding how code works, practicing through small projects, and slowly building confidence with tools like GitHub and VS Code.



Technical Skills :

- Languages: Python, C++ (beginner)
- Frameworks: Django (learning)
- Tools: GitHub, VS Code, PowerPoint
- Topics: OOP in Python, basic AI/ML concepts, web development fundamentals



Projects :

- Django Word Counter :  
  A simple web app that counts the number of words from user input. Made with Django.

- First WebApp : 
  A practice Django project where I explored views, templates, and URLs.
